The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there's a subtle bug that can occur when using `calc()` with percentages and other units.  If you try to calculate a percentage based on a value that hasn't yet been resolved, you may get unexpected results. This is especially common when using nested elements and percentages relative to their parent container.

For example:

```css
.parent {
  width: 50%;
}

.child {
  width: calc(50% + 20px);
}
```

If the parent's width isn't defined properly, or relies on a parent itself using percentage width, the child's calculation might be incorrect because the `50%` in `calc()` is based on an unresolved parent width.
